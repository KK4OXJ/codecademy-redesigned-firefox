# Codecademy Redesigned

**Restyles the Codecademy forums and adds several new features, as well as fixing a few of the bugs on Codecademy**

This extension combines several previous extensions and completely revolutionizes your experience on Codecademy. This extension does the following:

- Restyles the Q&A Forums making it fit in seamlessly with the new UI, rather than the old clunky look and feel of the forum pages.

- Lets you link to a specific response or comment in the Q&A forums by clicking the time stamp.

- Adds the correct exercise number into Q&A question pages (previously broken). Many thanks to [Joah Gerstenberg](https://www.joahg.com) who built the original extension to do this.

- Adds a link in the footer to a GitHub repository containing old posts saved from Groups, including many useful tutorials.

- Shows the number of unread notifications in the tab title and uses Desktop notifications to alert you when there's a new one.

- Updates the Profile Page, adding 'points today', 'best points day', and best day streak' back into the profile.

Enjoy the updates, we plan on adding many more :)
